[AWS Review Notes Table of Contents](https://github.com/pslucas0212/AWS-Review-Notes)

### Understanding the Shared Responsibility Model
- In the public cloud, there is a shared security responsibility between you and AWS.
- AWS is responsible for protecting and securing their infrastructure.
  - AWS is responsible for its global infrastructure elements: Regions, edge locations, and Availability Zones.
  - Building security. AWS controls access to its data centers where your data resides.
  - AWS maintains networking components: generators, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems, computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units, fire suppression systems, and more.
  - AWS is responsible for any managed service like RDS, S3, ECS, or Lambda, patching of host operating systems, and data access endpoints.
- You are responsible for how the services are implemented and managing your application data. 
  - Application data.  You are responsible for managing your application data, which includes encryption options.
  - Security Configuration. You are responsible for securing your account and API calls, rotating credentials, restricting internet access from your VPCs, and more.
  - Patching. You are responsible for the guest operating system (OS), which includes updates and security patches.
  - Identity and Access Managment. You are responsible for application security and identity and access management.
  - Network Traffic.  You are responsible for network traffic protection, which includes security group firewall configuration.
  - Installed software.  You are responsible for network traffic protection, which includes security group firewall configuration.

### Leveraging the Well-Architected Framework
- The 6 pillars of the Well-Architected Framework describe design principles and best practices for running workloads in the cloud.


- Here are a few examples of applying best practices and design principles from the 6 pillars of the Well-Architected Framework in the real world. 
  - Operational Exellence
    - You can use AWS CodeCommit for version control to enable tracking of code changes and to version-control CloudFormation templates of your infrastructure.
  - Security
    - You can configure central logging of all actions performed in your account using CloudTrail.
  - Reliability
    - You can use Multi-AZ deployments for enhanced availability and reliability of RDS databases.
  - Performance Efficiency
    - You can use AWS Lambda to run code with zero administration. 
  - Cost Optimization
    - You can use S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically move your data between access tiers based on your usage patterns.
  - Sustainability
    - You can use EC2 Auto Scaling to ensure you are maximizing utilization.


### Understanding IAM Users
**Identity and Access Management (IAM)**  IAM allows you to control access to your AWS services and resources. Permissions. Roles. MFA
  - Helps you secure your cloud resources
  - You define who has access
  - You define what they can do
  - A free global service
- Identites vs Access
  - Identities. Who can access your resources
    - Root user
    - Individual users
    - Groups
    - Roles
  - Acess.  Whatresources they can acces
    - Policies
    - AWS managed policies
    - Customer managed policies
    - Permissions boundaries


**Authntication (Who) vs Authorization (What)**
  - Authentication is where you present your identity (username) and provide verification (password).
  - Authorization determines which services and resources the authenticated identity has access to.


**Users** are entities you create in IAM to represent the person or application needing to access your AWS resources.
  - The root user is created when you first open your AWS account. 
  - What can only the root user do?
    - Close your account
    - Change email address
    - Modify your support plan
  - Individual users are created in IAM and are used for everyday tasks.
  - What can individual users do?
    - Perform administrative tasks 
    - Access application code
    - Launch EC2 instances
    - Configure databases
  - Did you know applications can be users?
  - You'll create a user in IAM so you can generate access keys for an application running on-premises that needs access to your cloud resources.
  
  - Don't forget activity performed by users in your account is billed to your account!

  - The principle of least privilege involves giving a user the minimum access required to get the job done.
    - Create access keys for an IAM user that needs access to the AWS CLI. The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to access resources in your AWS account through a terminal or command window. Access keys are needed when using the CLI and can be generated using IAM.


**Groups** A group is a collection of IAM users that helps you apply common access controls to all group members.
    - Administrators perform administrative tasks such as creating new users.
    - Developers use compute and database services to build applications.
    - Analysts run budget and usage reports.
  - ***Note:*** Do not confuse security groups for EC2 with IAM groups. EC2 security groups act as firewalls, while IAM groups are collections of users.
  - Key Takeaways - Groups
    -  Used to group users that perform similar tasks.
    -  Access permissions apply to all members of the group.
    -  Access is assigned using policies and roles.
  -  Apply the same access controls to a large set of users.  Groups save you time by allowing you to apply the same access permissions to more than one user at once. When a user no longer needs access, they can be removed from the group.

- Studying for the Exam
  - Users and groups
    - Going into the exam, understand the differences between users and group.
  - Root user tasks
    - Remember the tasks that only the root user can do. 
  - Principle of least privilege
    - Don't forget about the principle of least privilege.
  - Real-world use cases
    - Don't forget the real-world use cases for IAM.

### Understanding IAM Permissions

**Roles** Roles define access permissions and are temporarily assumed by an IAM user or service.
- You assume a role to perform a task in a single session.
- Assumed by any user or service that needs it.
- Access is assigned using policies.
- You grant users in one AWS account access to resources in another AWS account.

- You can attach a role to an instance that provides privileges (e.g., uploading files to S3) to applications running on the instance. Roles help you avoid sharing long-term credentials like access keys and protect your instances from unauthorized access.

**Policies** You manage permissions for IAM users, groups, and roles by creating a policy document in JSON format and attaching it.
- You can add a bucket access policy directly to an Amazon S3 bucket to grant IAM users access permissions for the bucket and the objects in it.

**IAM Best Practices**
- Enable MFA for privileged users. 
  - You should enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the root user and other administrative users.
- Implement strong password policies. 
  - You should require IAM users to change their passwords after a specified period of time, prevent users from reusing previous passwords, and rotate security credentials regularly.
- Create individual users instead of using root.
  - You shouldn't use the root user for daily tasks. 
- Use roles for Amazon EC2 instances.
  - You should use roles for applications that run on EC2 instances instead of long-term credentials like access keys.

**IAM Credential Report** The IAM credential report lists all users in your account and the status of their various credentials.
- Lists all users and status of passwords, access keys, and MFA devices
- Used for auditing and compliance

- Studying for the Exam
  - Users, groups, roles, and policies
    - Going into the exam, understand the differences between users, groups, roles, and policies.
  - IAM best practices
    - Don't forget to familiarize yourself with IAM best practices.
  - Real-world use cases
    - Don't forget the real-world use cases for IAM.
  - IAM credential report
    - Don't forget the importance of the IAM credential report.

### Exploring Application Security Services
AWS has several software-based security tools available to help you monitor and protect your resources.

**Firewall** 
 - Firewalls prevent unauthorized access to your networks by inspecting incoming and outgoing traffic against security rules you've defined. 

**WAF (Web Application Firewall)** WAF helps protect your web applications against common web attacks.
- Protects apps against common attack patterns
- Protects against cross-site scripting
- Protects against SQL injection
- You can deploy a web application directly to an EC2 instance and protect it from cross-site scripting attacks using WAF. You can even deploy WAF on CloudFront as part of your CDN solution to block malicious traffic.


**Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**
- A DDoS attack causes a traffic jam on a website or web application in an attempt to cause it to crash.

**Shield**  
Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service.
- Always-on detection
- Shield Standard is free
  - Provides free protection against common and frequently occurring attacks
- Shield Advanced is a paid service
  - Provides enhanced protections and 24/7 access to AWS experts for a fee
- DDoS protection via Shield Advanced is supported on several services.
  - CloudFront
  - Route53
  - Elastic Load Balancing
  - AWS Global Accelerator
- Shield Advanced will give you notifications of DDoS attacks via CloudWatch metrics. Additionally, with Shield Advanced, you have 24/7 access to AWS experts to assist during an attack.

**Macie** Macie helps you discover and protect sensitive data.
- Uses machine learning 
- Evaluates S3 environmen
- Uncovers personally identifiable information (PII) 
- Macie can be used to find sensitive data like passport numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers on S3.

- **Studying for the Exam**
  - WAF
    - Going into the exam, don't forget WAF protects against SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.
  - Shield
    - Don't forget Shield provides DDoS protection and works with CloudFront, Route 53, Elastic Load Balancing, and AWS Global Accelerator.
